Drupal To-Dos Module
===============

This module helps users keep track of their own to-do lists. It's in early development, so 
it has very minimal functionality. Once installed, you should see a link to your own to-do lists
and a drupal block displaying your lists.

### Requires

 * Entity API from http://drupal.org/project/entity

### Short term tasks

 * Add pagination functionality for lists/items
 * Write some tests

### Plans for the future

 * Add support for adding fields to to-do entities. That's part of the point of using Entity API!
 * Add integration with other drupal contrib modules (like Views/Panels, Rules, etc.)
